# Masters-Thesis-DSS
This repository hosts the Python notebook for the technical component of my thesis. It documents the complete workflow, including data handling, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation metrics, ensuring reproducibility and transparency. 

Unfortunately, everything is currently messy but will be cleaning them up the coming day :)
